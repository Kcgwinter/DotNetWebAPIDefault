      Please read the highlighted code and check for any mistakes. You should
      look for the following, and be extremely vigilant:
              - Syntax errors
              - Logic errors
              - Security vulnerabilities
              - Performance issues
              - Anything else that looks wrong
      Once you find an error, please explain it as clearly as possible, but
      without using extra words. 

      For example, instead of saying 'I think there is a syntax error on line
      5', you should say 'Syntax error on line 5'. 

      Give your answer as one bullet point per mistake found.
